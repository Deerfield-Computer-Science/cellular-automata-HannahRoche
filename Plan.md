Plan for project:
The world will consist of several lifeforms in a food chain, each having different abilities in terms of reproducing, eating,
and death. We will start with one top predator, one mid-level, one prey and one plant and expand if need be. As we begin to 
add and test creatures in the world, we can see if one lifeform seems to have an unfair advantage and edit as needed so 
that we bring our ecosystem to a place of fairness, as we will not be able to create something truly stable. As one of our 
questions we can look at what traits bring about the highest likelihood of survival and what happens if we alter them.

Things we need to do(more will need to be added as we continue):

	1	create a class of animals with abstract methods such as move, eat, etc.
	2	edit the lifeforms class and make methods to age/die of old age
	3	edit grass class(make realistic reproduce method)
	4	create another variable for lifeforms called survival number
	â—¦	Survival number can be from 0-10 and when a lifeform originates, it starts with a mid-level survival and as it does things such as eat, age, etc. it increases or decreases and certain benefits come with a higher survival #(ex. an animal with a 9 can move twice as fast than an animal of the same species with a 5)
	5	create 3 animals with different traits and begin testing



*** other ideas for factors to include could be sunniness/ rainfall which could affect different lifeforms in different ways
